<p>Patron's Message</p>

<I> I deem it to be my mission in life to facilitate the realization of his dream of creating generations of future leaders, who would emerge from the portals of this School to sail forth into the world, as men and women of character; as better citizens of our great nation and of the world of tomorrow.
I assure you that it is with this very ideal in mind that we strive to follow our mission; with never-changing ideals in mind and with our feet forever walking into tomorrow.
Our founder Chairman, who put forth the values which form the edifice of our School, believed in simple living and high thinking. Blessed with innate leadership traits, an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a keen aesthetic sense, he lived his life with a purpose, i.e. to work selflessly for the betterment of the community at large.</I>
